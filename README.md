# DocAI - An app to heal the world

DocAI is a mobile application built with Flutter that acts as a personal AI-powered doctor. It features a native chat interface powered by OpenRouter, chat history (mock for now), predefined health presets (e.g., medications, natural remedies), a profile page for subscription management, and a minimalist login screen. This README provides instructions to set up, install, and run the app on your local machine.

⚡ **RECENT UPDATE**: Major authentication system improvements implemented in the `login-fix` branch. See [AUTHENTICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md](AUTHENTICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for details.

## 🆕 Authentication System Improvements

**Branch**: `login-fix`  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for merge

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (version 3.0 or higher)
  - Install from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)
  - Run `flutter doctor` to verify setup

- **Dart** (included with Flutter)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter and Dart plugins
- **Android Emulator** or physical Android device (for Android)
- **Xcode** (for iOS, macOS only)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for potential future web builds, optional)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Accounts and API keys**:
  - Supabase account ([supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
  - OpenRouter API Key ([openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai))

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oriolgds/docai.git
cd docai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to fetch all required packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://your-site-or-landing-page.example
```

- Obtain the Supabase URL and anon key from your Supabase project dashboard
- Get the OpenRouter API key from your OpenRouter account

### 4. Configure Supabase

1. Create a new project on Supabase
2. Enable email authentication in the Supabase dashboard
3. Create the following tables:
   - `users` (id, email, subscription_level)
   - `chats` (id, user_id, timestamp, content)
   - `subscriptions` (id, user_id, plan, expiry_date)

4. Update the Supabase client initialization in `lib/main.dart` with your project URL and anon key (if not using .env)

### 5. Set Up Flutter

Ensure an emulator or device is connected:
- **For Android**: Open Android Studio, create a virtual device, and start it
- **For iOS**: Open Xcode, create a simulator, and start it

Run `flutter devices` to list available devices.

## Running the App

### 1. Build and Run
Execute the following command to start the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

Select the desired device from the list if multiple are connected.
The app will launch on the chosen emulator or device.

### 2. Initial Setup

Upon first launch, the app will display the login screen.
Use a test email (e.g., `test@example.com`) and password to log in (ensure these are registered in Supabase or modify the auth logic for testing). The dashboard will appear, allowing access to the chat, history, and profile screens.

### 3. Testing Features

- **Chat**: Type a health-related query (e.g., "What are the side effects of aspirin?") to test the OpenAI integration
- **Presets**: Select a preset (e.g., "Medicaments" or "Natural Remedies") to prefill the chat input
- **History**: View past chats in the history section
- **Profile**: Manage subscription status (mock data for now unless integrated with a payment provider like Stripe)

## Configuration and Customization

- **Theme**: The app uses a black-and-white minimalist theme. Modify `lib/theme.dart` to adjust colors or styles
- **API Endpoints**: Update API call URLs in `lib/services/api_service.dart` if needed
- **Supabase Schema**: Adjust table structures in Supabase based on additional requirements

## Troubleshooting

- **Flutter Issues**: Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` if dependencies fail to load
- **API Errors**: Verify `.env` file contents and network connectivity
- **Build Errors**: Ensure Xcode/Android SDK tools are updated
- **Authentication Issues**: Check [AUTHENTICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md](AUTHENTICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for recent fixes
- **Preset Issues**: Verify Firebase Remote Config setup in [PROMPT_PRESETS_CONFIG.md](PROMPT_PRESETS_CONFIG.md)

## 🤖 Dynamic Model Management

The app now features **dynamic model management** through Firebase Remote Config:

### Key Features:
- **Real-time model updates** without app updates
- **Custom branding** with configurable names and colors
- **Automatic fallback** when models become unavailable
- **5-minute cache** for optimal performance
- **Reasoning support** for advanced models

### Current Models:
- **Doky Instant** → `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`
- **Doky Balanced** → `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free`
- **Doky Reasoning** → `deepseek/deepseek-reasoner:free`
- **Doky Pro** → `x-ai/grok-4-fast:free`
- **Doky Modal** → `Llama 3.2 3B` (via Modal Labs)

### Configuration:
Models are managed through Firebase Remote Config. See [REMOTE_CONFIG_SETUP.md](REMOTE_CONFIG_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Modal Labs Integration:
DocAI now supports Modal Labs for running custom models. See [MODAL_LABS_INTEGRATION.md](MODAL_LABS_INTEGRATION.md) for setup and usage details.

### Error Handling:
